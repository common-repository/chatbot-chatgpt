## Tips

- **Content Relevance**: Include only the content types that are relevant to your chatbotâ€™s purpose. For instance, if your chatbot primarily provides customer support, you might include products and approved comments but exclude blog posts.

- **Performance Considerations**: Excluding less relevant content can improve indexing performance and reduce the load on your server.

- **Updating Settings**: Revisit these settings periodically, especially if your content strategy changes, to ensure the chatbot indexes the most relevant information.

By configuring these settings, you ensure that your Kognetiks Chatbot indexes only the content that is most pertinent to its function, improving the relevance and accuracy of the information it provides to users.
